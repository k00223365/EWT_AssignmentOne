                    Minister for Social Protection Leo Varadkar and Minister for Housing Simon Coveney have said Fine Gael TDs need to get ready for an early general election.<br>
                    <br>
                    Both Ministers, widely seen as the two leading contenders to take over from party leader Enda Kenny, made the statements while addressing the weekly meeting of the Fine Gael parliamentary party, which discussed the fallout from the controversy over an alleged smear campaign against Garda whistleblower Sgt Maurice McCabe by senior gardaí.<br>
                    <br>
                    It is understood the messages delivered by Mr Varadkar and Mr Coveney were co-ordinated.<br>
                    <br>
                    Following the Ministerial interventions, it is understood Mr Kenny suggested the party should return to its internal deliberations after it dealt with the Dáil motion on confidence in the Government on Wednesday night.<br>
                    <br>
                    The meeting came as Mr Kenny’s leadership of Fine Gael is under renewed pressure over his handling of the McCabe case.<br>
                    <br>
                    On Tuesday, Mr Kenny admitted that he gave details of a meeting with Minister for Children Katherine Zappone on the case which never took place.<br>
                    <br>
                    At Wednesday’s meeting, Mr Varadkar called Mr McCabe a “hero”.<br>
                    <br>
                    Mr Coveney stressed the need for the party to be united and Mr Varadkar called for another party meeting early next week.<br>
                    <br>
                    The comments by the Ministers are being interpreted by members of the party as a move towards a party leadership contest.
                    Others to comment on the need to prepare for an election at the meeting included Minister for Health Simon Harris and Minister of State Seán Kyne.<br>
                    <br>
                    At the meeting , Mr Kenny told Fine Gael TDs and Senators that the past week has “not been easy”, as the Government grappled with fallout from the Garda controversy.<br>
                    <br>
                    He told TDs that a public inquiry into the controversy was the best way of dealing with it.
                    He also said he wanted to get “down to the chamber”, understood to be a reference to the Dáil motion.<br>
                    <br>
                    Meanwhile, Martin Hedyon, the chair of the Fine Gael parliamentary party, told the gathering: “United we stand, divided we fall.” Minister for Finance Michael Noonan also listed the economic achievements of the Government, saying “how successful we have been with the economy and [how] practically every objective we have set has been achieved”, according to a source.<br>
                    <br>
                    However, one of those present at the meeting described the opening exchanges as an “anti-climax” and a predictable circling of the wagons. Leadership row Many Fine Gael TDs have been spooked by how close they believe the party came to a general election as a result of the controversy and Mr Kenny’s handling of the case.<br>
